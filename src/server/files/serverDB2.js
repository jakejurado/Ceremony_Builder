      "Marriage is the promise of hope between two people who love each other sincerely, who honor each other as individuals, and who wish to unite their lives and share the future together. In this ceremony, they dedicate themselves to the happiness and well-being of each other, in a union of mutual caring and responsibility.",
      "Taught by our own joys, by our own sorrows, even by our own failures, that in marriage, as in all life, whosoever insists upon saving their lesser goods and their little self, shall miss what is greater, but whosoever forgets themselves in devotion to their beloved and in consecration to their common enterprise, is surest to find a full and happy life.",
      "The values, traditions and hopes this couple represent have been nurtured by their family and friends standing here today. As our Sons and Daughters find partners and found homes for the next generation, each family is enriched and enlarged. Do you, who have nurtured these two, bestow your blessing on their union and their new life together as a family?",
      "To find someone with whom to love and grow and share your life is a rare and precious thing. PERSON_1 and PERSON_2 are fortunate to have found each other and our best wishes go to them with the hope that they find the patience to listen, the capacity to understand, and the compassion to give comfort; each day enjoying each other's company. May their marriage make a home where they both may find warmth, humor and above all happiness.",
      "PERSON_1 and PERSON_2 have come together in the hope that the love, which has brought them to this union, may touch the lives of all of us here today. The vows of marriage represent a deep and enduring commitment of love, respect, and friendship for one another.",
      "Taught by our own joys, by our own sorrows, even by our own failures, that in marriage, as in all life, who so ever insists upon saving their lesser goods and their little self, shall miss what is greater, but who so ever forgets themselves in devotion to their beloved and in consecration to their common enterprise, is surest to find a full and happy life.",
      "One of the greatest lesson life teaches us about marriage as well as all of relationships, is that those who hoard the goodness of life just for themselves, miss out on the best things of this world. But the ones who give of themselves...who share the wonders of life with others...devoting themselves to enrich the marriage, relationships, and friendships... it is those people who find a blessed life.",
      "It is fitting to speak briefly about love. We live in a world of joy and fear, and we search for meaning and strength in the seeming disorder. We discover the truest guideline to our quest when we realize love in all its magnitudes. Love is the eternal force of life. Love is the force that allows us to overcome all obstacles. May you always remember to give love freely and unconditionally from your heart. Preserve always yourself, your integrity, and your individuality; yet give of yourselves freely to each other.",
      "Marriage is the promise of hope between two people who love each other sincerely, who honor each other as individuals, and who wish to unite their lives and share the future together.",
      "Sooner or later we begin to understand that love is more than verses on valentines and romance in movies. We begin to know that love is here and now, real and true, the most important thing in our lives. For love is the creator of our favorite memories and the foundation of our fondest dreams. Without love, we merely exist. With love, we truly begin to live! For love is a promise that is always kept, a fortune that can never be spent, a seed that can flourish in even the most unlikely place. And this radiance that never fades, this mysterious and magical joy is the greatest treasure of all - one known only by those who truly love.",
      "Someone once said: The most wonderful of all things in life, is the discovery of another human being with whom one's relationship has a growing depth, beauty and joy as the years increase. This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing; it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It's a Divine destiny.",
      "They want this day to mean something special to you as guests. Those who are married may want to silently renew and reaffirm your vows today by gently taking the hand of your partner during this ceremony. Others may want to also join hands and think about what it means to be a friend, for marriage is built first on friendship",
      "There are no ties on earth so sweet, none so tender as those you are about to assume. There are no vows so solemn as those you are about to make. There is no institution of earth so sacred as that of the union you will form, for the true home is not only the place in which you will live, but is also the dwelling place where each lives in the heart and mind of the other.",

      'Marriage is an alliance entered into by a (man/woman) who can\'t sleep with a window shut, and a (woman/man who can\'s sleep with the window open.  \n If we take a moment to peel back a layer of this "attempted humor", we observe a greater truth pertaining to all marriages. As a man and women come together to be husband and wife....as they become one and attempt to align their values, priorities, and goals....there will always be pieces (ideology, habits, or values) that just don\'t easily fit together. There are compromising and agreements made in order to make the marriage thrive. \n If you think about it, this is at the source of most references to marriage within humor. \n "happy home is one in which each spouse grants the possibility that the other may be right, though neither believes it." \n  Two people coming together in a union of marriage does not work like snapping pieces together. We\'re not here because PERSON_1 and PERSON_2 looked at each other and thought, "our lives will assimilate and integrate with relative ease."   \n We\'re here today because when PERSON_1 looks into PERSON_2 and PERSON_2 looks into PERSON_1 they see something beautiful. They admire the qualities the other possesses. They understand the true value of each other and will do anything to be together for the rest of their life. \n And this is the beauty of marriage. Two people who admire and love each other so deeply and who will do anything...overcome any obstacles, working through any friction.... to be together and to build a relationship of substance and quality that will continually grow in depth, beauty, and joy as their years increase. \n  We are present today, as family and friends of PERSON_1 and PERSON_2 excited and celebrating their union for we see the start of this deepening love that will continually draw them closer as they spend your lives together.',
      "This love that was birthed from the moment they met, and has grown to what is before us today, has reached its final form. Their love will continue to be molded, shaped, and built upon as they share their lives with each other.",
      "PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, as you prepare to take these vows, give careful thought and prayer, for as you make them you are making an exclusive commitment one to the other for as long as you both shall live. Your love for each other should never be diminished by difficult circumstances, and it is to endure until death parts you. \n As God's children, your marriage is strengthened by your obedience to your Heavenly Father and His Word. As you let God be in control of your marriage, He will cause your home to be a place of joy and a testimony to the world.",
      "Our Savior has instructed that a man shall forsake his father and mother and cleave to his wife. By his apostles, he has instructed those who enter into this relation to cherish a mutual esteem and love, to bear with each other&'s infirmities and weaknesses; to comfort each other in sickness, trouble, and sorrow; in honesty and industry to provide for each other and for their household in temporal things; to pray for and encourage each other in the things which pertain to God; and to live together as heirs of the grace of life.",
      "To this sacred moment they bring the fullness of their hearts as a treasure and a gift from God to share with one another. They bring the dreams which bind them together in an eternal commitment. They bring their gifts and talents, their unique personalities and spirits, which God will unite together into one being as they build their life together. We rejoice with them in thankfulness to the Lord for creating this union of hearts, built on friendship, respect and love. \n Welcome, one and all. How beautiful is the day that is touched by love! May this be a moment to be remembered and cherished.",
      "Marriage is a very special spiritual connection of two people united for a common purpose, bringing love and trust together into single focus. We have come together in the presence of God (Love) to witness and bless the joining of this (man/woman) and this (woman/man) in Holy Matrimony. The bond and covenant of marriage was established by God in creation, and our Lord Jesus Christ adorned this manner of life by his presence and first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee. \n It signifies to us the mystery of the union between Christ and his Church, and Holy Scripture commends it to be honored among all who are gathered here.",
      "The union of wife and husband in heart, body, and mind is intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity; and their nurture in the knowledge and love of God. Therefore marriage is not to be entered into lightly, but reverently, deliberately, and in accordance with the purposes for which it was instituted by God.",

      "Challenging Adventure \n Marriage is perhaps the greatest and most challenging adventure of human relationships. No ceremony can create your marriage; only you can do that through love and patience; through dedication and perseverance; through talking and listening, helping and supporting and believing in each other; through tenderness and laughter; through learning to forgive, learning to appreciate your differences, and by learning to make the important things matter, and to let go of the rest. What this ceremony can do is to witness and affirm the choice you make to stand together as life-mates and partners.",
      "Marriage is \n The Ceremony of marriage in which you come to be united is one of the first and oldest ceremonies in all the world.  Marriage is a gift in that we give ourselves totally to one another.  I believe that marriage is a gift given to comfort the sorrows of life and to magnify life's joys \n Marriage is the clasping of hands, the blending of two hearts, the union of two lives into one and your marriage must stand, not by the authority of the state, nor by the seal on your wedding certificate, but by the strength and power of the faith and love you have in one another",
      "Enduring Commitment \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, you have come together in the hope that the love, which has brought you to this union, may touch the lives of all of us here today.   The vows of marriage represent a deep and enduring commitment of love, respect, and friendship for one another.",
      "Marriage and Love \n We live in a world of joy and fear, and we search for meaning and strength in the seeming disorder. We discover the truest guideline to our quest when we realize love in all its magnitudes. Love is the eternal force of life. Love is the force that allows us to overcome all obstacles. May you always remember to give love freely and unconditionally from your heart.  Preserve always yourself, your integrity, and your individuality; yet give of yourselves freely to each other.",
      "A Union \n We call marriages “unions”, not because some legal agreement is being entered into, but because two hearts are being molded together.  So you share your joys and hope as well as your sorrows and despairs.  It’s a molding of two hearts that will only remain strong by staying vulnerable, pure, and devoted.",
      "Spiritual union \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, true marriage is the holiest of all earthly unions. It is to be entered into reverently, consciously and with full understanding of its significance.  To be complete, marriage must be spiritual as well as an earthly estate. When it is Spiritual in thought, purpose, plan and action, it becomes the harmonious, peaceful and happy union for man and woman.",
      "One life \n The state of matrimony is true marriage only when it is based upon a deep, inner communion of two souls who find completion, each in the other.  Today, your separate lives, each with your individual memories, desires and hopes, merge into one life - a new dimension.",
      'Art of Marriage \n Happiness in marriage is not something that just happens. A good marriage must be created. In the art of marriage the little things are the big things.  Such a love requires that you be totally honest with yourself and your mate, that you ask for what you want, take action even though you are afraid, share your feelings and listen but leave your partner free to be who they really are. In other words, always love your partner for who they are, not for who you think they should be. \n Always remember, "Relationships are something that must be worked on all the time, not only when they are broken and need to be fixed. Never stop doing the things that brought you together in the first place." \n We as your friends gathered here today, accept for you a love that brings out your magnificence, a love that gives you the courage to stand apart and the willingness to stand together. When times call for you to be apart, may you always return to your togetherness in the same spirit of love that you are feeling in this moment. \n Most of all, we want that, at the end of your lives on this planet, you will look into each others eyes and be able to say: "Because you have loved me, you have given me a faith in myself, and because I have faith in myself, I have loved my fellow man. My life with you has been complete."',
      "Growing Relationship \n  PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, this love that was birthed from a friendship and that has grown to what is before us today, has not reached it’s final form.  Your love must continue to be molded, shaped, and built upon as you share your lives with each other in marriage.   Your marriage is intended to join you for life in a relationship so intimate that it will change your whole being. It offers you the hope, and indeed the promise, of a love that is true and mature.  To nurture this thriving love you must commit yourselves to remain vulnerable, pure and devoted to each other",
      "Serious Decision \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, you have made a very serious and important decision in choosing to marry each other today. You are entering into a sacred bond as life partners. The quality of your marriage will reflect what you put into nurturing this relationship. You have the opportunity to go forward from this day to create a faithful, kind, and tender relationship. \n This is a blessed day for you, PERSON_1 and PERSON_2.  It is up to you to keep the blessings flowing each and every day of your lives together. We wish for you the wisdom, compassion, and constancy to create a beautiful marriage in which you can both grow in love.",
      "Marriage Covenant  \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, the covenant which you are about to make with each other is meant to be a beautiful and sacred expression of your love for each other. As you pledge your vows to each other, and as you commit your lives to each other, we ask that you do so in all seriousness, and yet with a deep sense of joy; with the deep conviction that you are committing yourselves to a dynamic growing relationship of trust, mutual support, and caring love.",
      "Hand in Hand \n Hand in Hand you enter marriage, hand in hand you step out in faith. The hand you freely give to each other, is both the strongest and the most tender part of your body. In the years ahead you will need both strength and tenderness. Be firm in your commitment. Don't let your grip become weak. And yet, be flexible as you go through change. Don't let your hold become intolerable. Strength and tenderness, firm commitment and flexibility, of such is a marriage made, hand in hand. \n Also remember that you don't walk this path alone. Don't be afraid to reach out to others when together you face difficulty. Other hands are there: friends, family, and the church. To accept an outreached hand is not an admission of failure, but an act of faith. For behind us, underneath us, around us all, are the outstretched arms of the Lord. It is into his hand, the hands of God in Jesus Christ, that, above all else, we commit this union of husband and wife. Amen",
      "Gift from God \n Marriage is a gift from God, a miracle. It is an opportunity to feel the joy of taking care of someone who takes care of you, to be challenged towards growth yet gently nurtured, to love deeply and receive it in return. \n It is about trust, friendship and having a partner to share all life has to offer. It is a commitment to participate in a process of mutual evolution, understanding and forgiveness. It is indeed a sacred union to be treated with reverence.  \n  May you both create, with God, a piece of heaven on earth.",
      "Love is... \n Sooner or later we begin to understand that love is more than verses on valentines and romance in movies. We begin to know that love is here and now, real and true, the most important thing in our lives. For love is the creator of our favorite memories and the foundation of our fondest dreams. \n Without love, we merely exist. With love, we truly begin to live!  For love is a promise that is always kept, a fortune that can never be spent, a seed that can flourish in even the most unlikely place. And this radiance that never fades, this mysterious and magical joy is the greatest treasure of all - one known only by those who truly love. \n We are together as friends, relatives and family to mark the end of one beginning and to recognize officially a new beginning which for PERSON_1 and PERSON_2 serves as a public affirmation of their friendship and their love.",
      "Marriage based on \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, you have come to love each other deeply and sincerely. That love has given you the desire to unite in marriage and to establish a home together. In this ceremony you are dedicating yourselves to give happiness and well-being, each to the other. Your marriage is an act of faith. It must not be based on the vain hope of what the other will do or will not do, might become or might not become. It must be based on the firm belief in your own individual worth, and in the individual worth of the other. Your pledge today is an expression of your devotion. The words spoken in this ceremony will validate your marriage only if your love and commitment to one another are strong enough to sustain it",
      "Progressiveness of Love \n Someone once said: The most wonderful of all things in life, is the discovery of another human being with whom one's relationship has a growing depth, beauty and joy as the years increase.  This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing; it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It's a Divine destiny.",
      "Compilation \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, the Ceremony of marriage in which you come to be united is one of the first and oldest ceremonies in all the world. Marriage is a gift in that we give ourselves totally to one another. Marriage is a gift given to comfort the sorrows of life and to magnify life's joys. Marriage is the clasping of hands, the blending of two hearts, the union of two lives into one.  \n Your marriage must stand, not by the authority of the state, nor by the seal on your wedding certificate, but by the strength and power of the faith and love you have in one another \n It will stand by at no time taking the other for granted....by speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways.  By having the capacity to forgive and not bring it up later.  Marriage requires that you be totally honest with yourself and your partner, that you ask for what you want, take action even though you're afraid, share your feelings and listen but leave your partner free to be who they really are. In other words, always love your partner for who they are, not for who you think they should be. \n Marriage is also perhaps the greatest and most challenging adventure of human relationships. No ceremony can create your marriage; only you can do that – through love and patience; through dedication and perseverance; through talking and listening, helping and supporting and believing in each other; through tenderness and laughter; through learning to forgive, learning to appreciate your differences, and by learning to make the important things matter, and to let go of the rest. What this ceremony can do is to witness and affirm the choice you make to stand together as lifemates and partners. \n So From this day onward you must come closer together than ever before, you must love one another in sickness and in health, for better or for worse, but at the same time your love should give you the strength to stand apart, to seek out your destinies, to make your special contribution to the world which is always part of us and more than us. \n Today, as you join yourselves in marriage, there is a vast and unknown future stretching out before you. The possibilities and potentials of your married life are great; and now falls upon your shoulders the task of choosing values  and making choices that will be not about yourself but for one another. The union of Marriage is more than just a title you obtain of being “husband and wife.”  Marriage is vast commitment to live life together. \n We bless you this day. It is up to you to keep the blessings flowing each and every day of your lives together. We wish for you the wisdom, compassion, and constancy to create a peaceful sanctuary in which you can both grow in love.",
      "Superhero \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, this love that was birthed from a friendship started a thousand miles apart with a connection over a superhero game.  Little did you know that when you first started playing that game of superheroes, how it would alter the course of your life and set you on a path bringing you to this moment.  But why should the influence of those superheroes stop here?  I believe that they have valuable wisdom to impart to your marriage. \n One of the marks of superhero is a profound understanding of sacrifice.   The idea that they must give up some small aspect of their life in order to better the world around them.  There's a letting go of some of their individual rights or privileges so that they can gain the benefit of a healthier world.   Marriages works the same way.  There are smaller sacrifices that must be made in order to obtain the fulfillment of something bigger.  There needs to be a recognition that you're in life together now and that the potential and the happiness coming from your marriage will far outweigh anything you'll obtain by accomplishing something on your own.  I'm not talking about losing your identity or individuality, but making choices as a couple and looking out for more than just your individual interest. \n Unfortunately, in the world of superheroes, they don’t have anybody sacrificing for them the same way that they sacrifice for the world.  They don't have anybody to take care of them.  But what you will find is that as you give up of yourself for your partner, your partner will be sacrificing for you. \n Superheroes also have the ability to see the true value of people.  When humanity is at its worst, superheroes still see them as worth saving.  Even when all the city is in uproar and despises them, they don't let go of their belief in humanity.  PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, as a married couple, who knows what situations you'll go through... Who knows the pleasure or the pain that you'll face together.  But no matter what you go through, you can never give up believing in your spouse.  You can never let go of the beauty inside that you see now.  You can never forget the love that has penetrated your hearts and taken over your lives.  You can never forget the uniqueness....or how special is the person whose hands you’re holding.   \n There may come a time where one of you will lose faith in yourself.  Where you'll question your value....you'll question your worth.  You won't know if you have what it takes to succeed in a certain area or to achieve a goal.  That is where if one is feeling this way, the other must give hope and encouragement.  You come in and provide perspective that is needed.  This is where you articulate every beautiful attribute you see in the other.  This is the point where you communicate why you're in love. \n This type of love requires a life of intimacy and trust with each other.  So from this day onward you must come closer together than ever before, you must love one another in sickness and in health, for better or for worse. \n We wish blessings upon you this day. It is up to you to keep the blessings flowing each and every day of your lives together. We wish for you the wisdom, compassion, and constancy to create a peaceful sanctuary in which you can both grow in love.",
      "Long Distance Relationship \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, for the greater part of your relationship, you have lived in different cities, pursuing your educational goals and careers, stealing weekends, breaks, and time off to be together.   One way of thinking about it is that your jobs or education were pulling you in different directions, being obstacles for your relationship, so you did whatever you had to in order to come together.  So much of your relationship was driving or flying to be together in order to spend time cultivating your relationship. \n Those were not easy years.  It wasn't convenient spending hours driving and flying, but the rewards were obviously worth it.  You both found someone that enhances life...that brings so much more laughter and happiness into your world.  You found someone that balances you out, makes you a better person, and just makes life that much more sweeter.  I'm sure those obstacles were annoying at times, but you saw the greater picture...that this person, who is standing next you, was worth it. \n Now you're in a new phase of life.  You are being joined together as husband and wife.  You live together...no longer are jobs or school providing the same obstacle they once were.  You mindset is no longer, \"I have to see him / I have to see her,\" or \"I have to get there.\"  You are there.  You no longer have to drive towards each other.  Now that you are being joined as husband and wife, you find yourself driving together.  You're on a new path.  You're pursuing new goals together.  It's not so much now about the destination, because you’ve found the secret joy in life.   Your destination, goals, and things you pursue will enhance what you have, but it is the the journey that is so much more fun because you're together.  Working together to pursue your dreams will grow your trust, love and excitement, and will draw you closer. \n There is one caution I would like to mention.  Now that you no longer have to fight off the pull of jobs or education to be in the same city, it is easy to relax and stop pursuing each other with the same dedication you had before.  It's natural to slow down, but don't get too comfortable, because you're both constantly changing, growing, forming new thoughts, opinions and dreams.  Each of you will encounter different circumstances or situations that affect you and transform you in some way.  So I encourage you to never stop probing, questioning, talking.... Never stop pursuing and exploring the workings inside each other's heart and mind. \n Most likely you'll find new reasons to fall in love with each other all over again.  You'll find opportunities to express your love that you didn't know existed.  You'll find ideas on how to encourage or console each other.  You'll find a deep satisfaction in being emotionally and spiritually connected to each other. \n Your family and friends are here today because they have noticed what this love has done for you both, and they're overjoyed with what they see.  And so we hope for you that this love is just a seed that will grow in ways that we cannot fathom.",
      "Long Relationship \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, you have come here today not only to put into words the commitment and love which you have shared these last __ years, but to also express your intent to continually pursue and deepen the love you have developed thus far.  Because you have been in a relationship for this long, you have gone through everything together.  You have faced moments of struggle and pain as well as elation and joy.  You have endured situations which brought tension to your relationship, but also enjoyed moments that have uplifted you.   \n So in __ years you have come to understand what it takes to have a thriving relationship.  You understand the sacrifices... the compromises... the patience... forgiveness... and the trust that is asked of you to maintain and grow as a couple.  You know that along with the magical feelings of love, contentment, and pure joy also comes some struggles. \n And let's be honest here, you have probably, at this point in your relationship, seen the worst in each other.  And because of that, this moment becomes all the more special.  By standing here today, having shared these last __ years together, experiencing the ebbs and flows of a relationship, you're saying I would never give up or throw away the time we've had together.  You're saying, \"I accept you and value you as you truly are.  I have seen you with your face unhidden, your heart unprotected, and I believe you are beautiful.\"",
      "Strength \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, the beautiful aspect about marriage is the strength that comes out of your union.  1) Marriage has this way, if done right, to bring confidence and appreciation for who you are as a person.  Because you share \"life\" with your spouse, your partner is able to see you in every situation, when you're at your best but also when you're at your worst.  You will be seen at your ugliest moments, but the strength and encouragement comes from the fact that even though you are experienced at your lowest moments, where the worst side of you comes out, you'll find a partner who doesn't run away, but loves you unconditionally, believes in you completely, supports you fully, and still sees you as the treasure of their life.  It's being seen at your worst and yet still receiving love that gives a person confidence, strength, and comfort with who they are. \n 2) Your relationship has given you strength because you have a partner who makes you a better person. &nbsp;The personality, the traits, and the characteristics that you love about each other... slowly over time are added to who you are....they rub off on you... you take them on. &nbsp;So the areas inside of you that had not been developed before you met are now being strengthen, making you more dynamic of a person.  \n 3) Marriage gives you strength because you'll always have a partner on your side to give encouragement when down or wisdom in difficult situations.  The voice of your partner can be a point of inspiration or the place where wisdom tells you to let it go and walk away.  There may come a time where you will lose faith in yourself.  Where you'll question your value....you'll question your worth.  You won't know if you have what it takes to succeed in a certain area or to achieve a goal.   Because of your relationship, you'll have someone that will lift your spirits.  You'll be given a healthy perspective and the strength to go on. \n 4) Strength flows out of your marriage because because you develop a special bond.  You see and know each other in a way that nobody else does.  You're allowed into deepest parts of each other's hearts and mind and the fact that that you love what you see gives an incredible amount of confidence and assurance to your partner. \n 5) Strength comes from your union because you always have a person who is looking out for you...a person who is doing the small things to make your day go smoother... a person who gets fulfillment out of filling your days with happiness. \n 6) But I think the greatest source of strength comes because one's marriage is place of pure enjoyment.  When you have someone that you can just have a good time with... whose conversations are fun...and whose personality is beautiful...then life becomes easy.  Days, instead of dragging on, go by too fast.  Even though you spend most of your time together, it's still not enough.  No matter what happens to you when you're a part, it can never match enjoyment you have together.  As long as you both stay deeply connected with each other, displaying your love and keeping your trust, you will give each other strength. \n Your family and friends are here today, because we see the strength that you get from each other...we see the pure enjoyment you have when you're together....we see the encouragement and strength that your partner gives you.  Our hope is that you continue to make every effort to value your spouse and the voice of your partner.  Never write them off or allow your admiration to turn to disdain, because once you do that, the source of your greatest strength will be be gone.  The person whose words can build you up will have no meaning.   So we hope that you will do everything in your power to work through hurt and pain.  We hope that you never let your disagreements put a wedge between your hearts and that you talk and work through everything with love and forgiveness. \n Finally, we hope that you be intentional with your words and actions....that you see yourself and your role in this marriage as being a person who builds up, encourages, and provides strength for your partner.  For we believe that because of your marriage you will both be better people.  You're life will be transformed by your years together.  Come the end of your days here on earth, you will be able to say that because of you, I achieved more than I could on my own, I grew as person, I loved in ways I didn't know were possible, and I lived a life that was full of joy, triumphs, and happiness.",
      "Winnie The Pooh \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, before we come to the point where you will exchange vows and rings with each other, I want to impart some encouraging words words from a wise story. \n Winnie the Pooh has a dear friend named Tigger.  \n \"The wonderful thing about Tiggers \n Is Tiggers are wonderful things \n Their tops are made of rubber \n Their bottoms are made out of springs \n They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy \n  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun\" \n In this particular fable, Tigger was looking for someone to have fun with and so he went from one friend to another, in the 100 acre woods, but everyone he visited was busy.  He tried harder to join in with what the others were doing, but ultimately causes nothing but trouble, destroying Eeyore's house and covering all of his friends in mud. \n Everyone is mad at Tigger and so he ends up feeling alone and out of place. \n Through an idea planted in his head, Tigger decides to write a letter to his family that he's never met....we don't even know if they even exist.  He thinks that there's got to be others like him....Others who bounce and bounce and bounce and bounce.  He gets so much hope from this idea that he has a family and place where he belongs.  And if he can find them....He'll find happiness....He'll find his  niche in the world..He'll find his Belonging \n He places the letter in the mail box and then waits for a reply, but none comes.  He is crushed. \n Now if you know anything about Winnie the Pooh and his friends then you know how much fun they have together.  Their days are filled with adventure and laughter.  They're always looking after one another and sharing what they have.  They all enjoy each others company and have a deep bond.  The reason why the stories of Winnie the Pooh and the 100 Acre Woods are so popular is that we all wish we could live there and experience the friendships they have \n What's weird about this story is how Tigger lets one day of disappointments distract him from his happiness.  They may not be exactly like him, but he's found a place where he belongs...where he fits in...where he's found his niche among those he loves and who loves him. \n Once his disappointments overtake his perspective he begins to see happiness and belonging as something over the hill or in another place that he has to go find.  And he builds up this promise of happiness that is just outside of his reach. \n So all of the animals (Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Roo) get together and write him a lovely letter and they sign it, \"your family\" and then place it in Tigger's mail box.  The next day Tigger finds the letter and is overcome with Joy.  He has a family.  He reads in between the lines and assumes they're going to come and visit him the next day. \n The story goes on and fiasco ensues.  A lot of good intentions from his friends is misunderstood as a nefarious act and so Tigger runs away, never to come back. He is hurt and alone. \n His friends (Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Roo, ect..) go looking for him and find him... there's some danger...and a rescue...  and then there's this moment where it's revealed to Tigger that it is his friends who wrote him the letter.  And then it hits him...EVERYTHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR IN HIS FAMILY...the belonging, the love, the happiness, HE HAS WITH HIS FRIENDS. \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, I tell you this story in order to encourage you in your life as husband and wife.  Everything that Pooh, Tigger, Piglet & Eeyore have in the 100 Acre Woods, You have and more.  You have a love that makes you better people.  You have an underlying happiness that fills your days with joy and laughter.  The way you talk about each other is intoxicating.  You have an accepting love... a love that fully enjoys and relishes the presence of each other.  A love that is gentle and yet has the capacity to challenge...to grow... to live your potential and seek your dreams. \n You have each found someone that you fit well together with, so you have a place where you belong, where you're encouraged, loved, valued. \n There will be moments of disappointments....days when your disheartened.  It is in those times where the small negative often overshadows all the good.  And in those moments it is easy to get caught up in these lies that true happiness is just over the hill....just out of your reach.  That if you only had that thing then you would be happy.  Or if only things were this way.... if only you had a bigger this or more of that...  \n There will be promises that tell you, \"oh, you can find real happiness over there...or if you get this...or if you do that.\"  Promises that say happiness is just over that hill...just out of your reach. \n But over there....the grass on the other side...  PERSON_2, you won't find anything like PERSON_1! PERSON_1, you won’t find anything like PERSON_2.  You are holding something special in your hands right now that no promise can beat.  So whenever disappointments come or you begin to feel disheartened, remind yourself that you live in the 100 Acre Woods!",
      "Light Cheesy Humor with some Deeper Words \n Marriage is a great institution.  No, marriage is grand institution.  And we are all thrilled and overjoyed to be here today, for we recognize how rare it is to find two people, who want to live together...in an institution. \n Now, we joke about marriage because there is something crazy about marriage.   Marriage is the most intimate and revealing relationship that two people can enter into, which means for most of us, you can no longer hide behind your mask of sanity.   From now on there will always be one person who sees you for who you really are.  They know your quirks and your crazy buttons.  They see you day in and day out and know your habits.  They see you brushing your teeth in the shower or putting your pants on two legs at a time.  Slowly over time with intimacy you allow your spouse to see how crazy you really are. \n For some people that thought is scary, because it carries the question, \"What if my partner doesn't like what he/she sees?\"  When you open yourself up and become vulnerable, you risk the chance of being hurt.  But there is a flipside to that fear.  One author writes: \n \"The married are those who have taken the terrible risk of intimacy and, having taken it, know life without intimacy to be impossible.\" \n When you take the risk of vulnerability....when you truly let someone in so that they see everything... your quirks and your uniqueness... and then you feel and experience depth of their love and acceptance,  you will never be able to go back to life without intimacy.  You will find freedom and peace to be who you are.  You will find encouragement and affirmation.  I believe this is why we are here today.   Because you two have tasted that intimacy....that acceptance from one another... and you want more. If allowing someone to come so close to you that it has brought you to this moment full of happiness, joy, and celebration, imagine where it will take you. \n As you pursue intimacy in marriage you will find that it will also lead you to something else.  For now that you feel safe enough and secure enough in another's love to be vulnerable, something special happens. \n One author puts it this way, \n \"One of the best wedding gifts [life] gave you was a full-length mirror called your spouse.  Had there been a card attached, it would have said, -Here's to helping you discover what you're really like.\" \n Now I don't think that's a bad thing.  Having someone so close that they can peer into the depths of your soul and reflect back what they see will do nothing but make you a better person.  Your partner will call you out when you're being ridiculous or when you're not doing your part.  Your companion will give you encouragement to hold true to your values and ideals.  Having a husband/wife in marriage will only make you stronger, wiser, more self aware, more compassionate, and more loving.  Thirty years down the line you will be able to look at each other and honestly say, \"because of you, I am a better person.",
      'Cheesy Humor with The Art of Marriage \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, Marriage is an alliance entered into by a man who can\'t sleep with a window shut, and a woman who can\'t sleep with the window open.   \n Of course I\'m joking, but if we take a moment to peel back a layer of this "attempted humor", we observe a greater truth pertaining to all marriages.  As a man and women come together to be husband and wife....as they become one and attempt to align their values, priorities, and goals....there will always be pieces (ideology, habits, or values) that just don\'t easily fit together.  There are compromising and agreements made in order to make the marriage thrive. \n If you think about it, this is at the source of most references to marriage within humor.  For example: \n "A happy home is one in which each spouse grants the possibility that the other may be right, though neither believes it." \n Two people coming together in a union of marriage does not work like snapping pieces together.  We\'re not here because you, PERSON_2, and you, PERSON_1, looked at each other and thought, "our lives will assimilate and integrate with relative ease." \n We\'re here today because when you, PERSON_2, look into PERSON_1 and you, PERSON_1, look into PERSON_2, you see something beautiful. You admire the qualities the other possesses.  You understand the true value of each other and will do anything to be together for the rest of their life. \n And this is the beauty of marriage.  Two people who admire and love each other so deeply and who will do anything...overcome any obstacles, working through any friction.... to be together.  \n Wilferd Peterson furthers this thought in a poem titled, "The Art of Marriage."  In this poem, he looks not just at how to keep a strong marriage, but how to fill it with happiness. \n Happiness in marriage is not something that just happens.  \n A good marriage must be created. \n In the art of marriage the little things are the big things... \n It is never being too old to hold hands. \n It is remembering to say "I love you" at least once a day. \n It is never going to sleep angry. \n It is at no time taking the other for granted; \n the courtship should not end with the honeymoon,it should continue through all the years. \n It is having a mutual sense of values and common objectives. \n It is standing together facing the world. \n It is forming a circle of love that gathers in the whole family. \n It is doing things for each other, not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, but in the spirit of joy. \n It is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways. \n It is not looking for perfection in each other. \n It is cultivating flexibility, patience, understanding and a sense of humour. \n It is having the capacity to forgive and forget. \n It is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow. \n It is finding room for the things of the spirit. \n It is a common search for the good and the beautiful. \n It is establishing a relationship in which the independence is equal, dependence is mutual and the obligation is reciprocal. \n It is not only marrying the right partner, it is being the right partner. \n It is discovering what marriage can be, at its best. \n PERSON_1 and PERSON_2, your family and friends who are present here today wish for you the wisdom, compassion, and consistency to create a beautiful marriage in which you can both grow in love and happiness',
