  <p>If we take a moment to peel back a layer of this "attempted humor", we observe a greater truth pertaining to all marriages. As a man and women come together to be husband and wife....as they become one and attempt to align their values, priorities, and goals....there will always be pieces (ideology, habits, or values) that just don&#39t easily fit together. There are compromising and agreements made in order to make the marriage thrive.</p><p>If you think about it, this is at the source of most references to marriage within humor.</p><p>"happy home is one in which each spouse grants the possibility that the other may be right, though neither believes it."</p><p> Two people coming together in a union of marriage does not work like snapping pieces together. We&#39re not here because <span class="brideName">________</span> and <span class="groomName">_ _ _ _</span> looked at each other and thought, "our lives will assimilate and integrate with relative ease."</p>\

They admire the qualities the other possesses. They understand the true value of each other and will do anything to be together for the rest of their life.</p><p>And this is the beauty of marriage. Two people who admire and love each other so deeply and who will do anything...overcome any obstacles, working through any friction.... to be together and to build a relationship of substance and quality that will continually grow in depth, beauty, and joy as their years increase.</p>\
  <p>We are present today, as family and friends of <span class="brideName">________</span> and <span class="groomName">_ _ _ _</span> excited and celebrating their union for we see the start of this deepening love that will continually draw them closer as they spend your lives together.</p>';

  "Our Savior has instructed that a man shall forsake his father and mother and cleave to his wife.

We rejoice with them in thankfulness to the Lord for creating this union of hearts, built on friendship, respect and love.<p>Welcome, one and all. How beautiful is the day that is touched by love! May this be a moment to be remembered and cherished.</p>";

  "Marriage is a very special spiritual connection of two people united for a common purpose, bringing love and trust together into single focus. We have come together in the presence of God (Love) to witness and bless the joining of this man and this woman in Holy Matrimony. The bond and covenant of marriage was established by God in creation, and our Lord Jesus Christ adorned this manner of life by his presence and first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee.<p>It signifies to us the mystery of the union between Christ and his Church, and Holy Scripture commends it to be honored among all who are gathered here.</p>";

Little did you know that when you first started playing that game of superheroes, how it would alter the course of your life and set you on a path bringing you to this moment.  But why should the influence of those superheroes stop here?  I believe that they have valuable wisdom to impart to your marriage.</p><p>One of the marks of superhero is a profound understanding of sacrifice.   The idea that they must give up some small aspect of their life in order to better the world around them.  There's a letting go of some of their individual rights or privileges so that they can gain the benefit of a healthier world.   Marriages works the same way.  There are smaller sacrifices that must be made in order to obtain the fulfillment of something bigger.  There needs to be a recognition that you're in life together now and that the potential and the happiness coming from your marriage will far outweigh anything you'll obtain by accomplishing something on your own.  I'm not talking about losing your identity or individuality, but making choices as a couple and looking out for more than just your individual interest.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the world of superheroes, they don’t have anybody sacrificing for them the same way that they sacrifice for the world.  They don't have anybody to take care of them.  But what you will find is that as you give up of yourself for your partner, your partner will be sacrificing for you.</p><p>Superheroes also have the ability to see the true value of people.

Even when all the city is in uproar and despises them, they don't let go of their belief in humanity.  <span class='brideName'>________</span> and <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, as a married couple, who knows what situations you'll go through...

One way of thinking about it is that your jobs or education were pulling you in different directions, being obstacles for your relationship, so you did whatever you had to in order to come together.  So much of your relationship was driving or flying to be together in order to spend time cultivating your relationship.</p>\
<p>Those were not easy years.  It wasn't convenient spending hours driving and flying, but the rewards were obviously worth it.  You both found someone that enhances life...that brings so much more laughter and happiness into your world.  You found someone that balances you out, makes you a better person, and just makes life that much more sweeter.  I'm sure those obstacles were annoying at times, but you saw the greater picture...that this person, who is standing next you, was worth it.</p>\
<p>Now you're in a new phase of life.  You are being joined together as husband and wife.  You live together...no longer are jobs or school providing the same obstacle they once were.  You mindset is no longer, 'I have to see him,' 'I have to see her,' or 'I have to get there.'  You are there.  You no longer have to drive towards each other.  Now that you are being joined as husband and wife, you find yourself driving together.  You're on a new path.  You're pursuing new goals together.  It's not so much now about the destination, because you’ve found the secret joy in life.   Your destination, goals, and things you pursue will enhance what you have, but it is the the journey that is so much more fun because you're together.  Working together to pursue your dreams will grow your trust, love and excitement, and will draw you closer.</p>\
<p>There is one caution I would like to mention.  Now that you no longer have to fight off the pull of jobs or education to be in the same city, it is easy to relax and stop pursuing each other with the same dedication you had before.  It's natural to slow down, but don't get too comfortable, because you're both constantly changing, growing, forming new thoughts, opinions and dreams.  Each of you will encounter different circumstances or situations that affect you and transform you in some way.  So I encourage you to never stop probing, questioning, talking.... Never stop pursuing and exploring the workings inside each other's heart and mind.</p>\
<p>Most likely you'll find new reasons to fall in love with each other all over again.  You'll find opportunities to express your love that you didn't know existed.  You'll find ideas on how to encourage or console each other.  You'll find a deep satisfaction in being emotionally and spiritually connected to each other.</p>\

Because you share 'life' with your spouse, your partner is able to see you in every situation, when you're at your best but also when you're at your worst.  You will be seen at your ugliest moments, but the strength and encouragement comes from the fact that even though you are experienced at your lowest moments, where the worst side of you comes out, you'll find a partner who doesn't run away, but loves you unconditionally, believes in you completely, supports you fully, and still sees you as the treasure of their life.  It's being seen at your worst and yet still receiving love that gives a person confidence, strength, and comfort with who they are.</p><p>2) Your relationship has given you strength because you have a partner who makes you a better person. &nbsp;The personality, the traits, and the characteristics that you love about each other... slowly over time are added to who you are....they rub off on you... you take them on. &nbsp;So the areas inside of you that had not been developed before you met are now being strengthen, making you more dynamic of a person. </p><p>3) Marriage gives you strength because you'll always have a partner on your side to give encouragement when down or wisdom in difficult situations.  The voice of your partner can be a point of inspiration or the place where wisdom tells you to let it go and walk away.  There may come a time where you will lose faith in yourself.  Where you'll question your value....you'll question your worth.  You won't know if you have what it takes to succeed in a certain area or to achieve a goal.   Because of your relationship, you'll have someone that will lift your spirits.  You'll be given a healthy perspective and the strength to go on.</p><p>4) Strength flows out of your marriage because because you develop a special bond.  You see and know each other in a way that nobody else does.  You're allowed into deepest parts of each other's hearts and mind and the fact that that you love what you see gives an incredible amount of confidence and assurance to your partner.</p><p>5) Strength comes from your union because you always have a person who is looking out for you...a person who is doing the small things to make your day go smoother... a person who gets fulfillment out of filling your days with happiness.</p><p>6) But I think the greatest source of strength comes because one's marriage is place of pure enjoyment.  When you have someone that you can just have a good time with... whose conversations are fun...and whose personality is beautiful...then life becomes easy.  Days, instead of dragging on, go by too fast.  Even though you spend most of your time together, it's still not enough.  No matter what happens to you when you're a part, it can never match enjoyment you have together.  As long as you both stay deeply connected with each other, displaying your love and keeping your trust, you will give each other strength.</p><p>Your family and friends are here today, because we see the strength that you get from each other...we see the pure enjoyment you have when you're together....we see the encouragement and strength that your partner gives you.  Our hope is that you continue to make every effort to value your spouse and the voice of your partner.  Never write them off or allow your admiration to turn to disdain, because once you do that, the source of your greatest strength will be be gone.  The person whose words can build you up will have no meaning.   So we hope that you will do everything in your power to work through hurt and pain.  We hope that you never let your disagreements put a wedge between your hearts and that you talk and work through everything with love and forgiveness.</p><p>Finally, we hope that you be intentional with your words and actions....that you see yourself and your role in this marriage as being a person who builds up, encourages, and provides strength for your partner.  For we believe that because of your marriage you will both be better people.  You're life will be transformed by your years together.  Come the end of your days here on earth, you will be able to say that because of you, I achieved more than I could on my own, I grew as person, I loved in ways I didn't know were possible, and I lived a life that was full of joy, triumphs, and happiness.</p>";

<p>In this particular fable, Tigger was looking for someone to have fun with and so he went from one friend to another, in the 100 acre woods, but everyone he visited was busy.  He tried harder to join in with what the others were doing, but ultimately causes nothing but trouble, destroying Eeyore's house and covering all of his friends in mud.</p>\
<p>Everyone is mad at Tigger and so he ends up feeling alone and out of place.</p>\
<p>Through an idea planted in his head, Tigger decides to write a letter to his family that he's never met....we don't even know if they even exist.  He thinks that there's got to be others like him....Others who bounce and bounce and bounce and bounce.  He gets so much hope from this idea that he has a family and place where he belongs.  And if he can find them....He'll find happiness....He'll find his  niche in the world..He'll find his Belonging</p><p>He places the letter in the mail box and then waits for a reply, but none comes.  He is crushed.</p><p>Now if you know anything about Winnie the Pooh and his friends then you know how much fun they have together.  Their days are filled with adventure and laughter.  They're always looking after one another and sharing what they have.  They all enjoy each others company and have a deep bond.  The reason why the stories of Winnie the Pooh and the 100 Acre Woods are so popular is that we all wish we could live there and experience the friendships they have</p>\
<p>What's weird about this story is how Tigger lets one day of disappointments distract him from his happiness.  They may not be exactly like him, but he's found a place where he belongs...where he fits in...where he's found his niche among those he loves and who loves him.</p>\
<p>Once his disappointments overtake his perspective he begins to see happiness and belonging as something over the hill or in another place that he has to go find.  And he builds up this promise of happiness that is just outside of his reach.</p>\
<p>So all of the animals (Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Roo) get together and write him a lovely letter and they sign it, 'your family' and then place it in Tigger's mail box.  The next day Tigger finds the letter and is overcome with Joy.  He has a family.  He reads in between the lines and assumes they're going to come and visit him the next day.</p>\
<p>The story goes on and fiasco ensues.  A lot of good intentions from his friends is misunderstood as a nefarious act and so Tigger runs away, never to come back. He is hurt and alone.</p\
>\
<p>His friends (Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Roo, ect..) go looking for him and find him... there's some danger...and a rescue...  and then there's this moment where it's revealed to Tigger that it is his friends who wrote him the letter.  And then it hits him...EVERYTHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR IN HIS FAMILY...the belonging, the love, the happiness, HE HAS WITH HIS FRIENDS.</p>\

<p>You have each found someone that you fit well together with, so you have a place where you belong, where you're encouraged, loved, valued.</p>\
<p>There will be moments of disappointments....days when your disheartened.  It is in those times where the small negative often overshadows all the good.  And in those moments it is easy to get caught up in these lies that true happiness is just over the hill....just out of your reach.  That if you only had that thing then you would be happy.  Or if only things were this way.... if only you had a bigger this or more of that... </p>\
<p>There will be promises that tell you,'oh, you can find real happiness over there...or if you get this...or if you do that.'

  "<strong>Light Cheesy Humor with some Deeper Words</strong><br/>Marriage is a great institution.  No, marriage is grand institution.  And we are all thrilled and overjoyed to be here today, for we recognize how rare it is to find two people, who want to live together...in an institution.</p><p>Now, we joke about marriage because there is something crazy about marriage.   Marriage is the most intimate and revealing relationship that two people can enter into, which means for most of us, you can no longer hide behind your mask of sanity.   From now on there will always be one person who sees you for who you really are.  They know your quirks and your crazy buttons.  They see you day in and day out and know your habits.  They see you brushing your teeth in the shower or putting your pants on two legs at a time.  Slowly over time with intimacy you allow your spouse to see how crazy you really are.</p>\
<p>For some people that thought is scary, because it carries the question, 'What if my partner doesn't like what he/she sees?'  When you open yourself up and become vulnerable, you risk the chance of being hurt.  But there is a flipside to that fear.  One author writes:</p>\
<p>'The married are those who have taken the terrible risk of intimacy and, having taken it, know life without intimacy to be impossible.'</p><p>When you take the risk of vulnerability....when you truly let someone in so that they see everything... your quirks and your uniqueness... and then you feel and experience depth of their love and acceptance,  you will never be able to go back to life without intimacy.  You will find freedom and peace to be who you are.  You will find encouragement and affirmation.  I believe this is why we are here today.   Because you two have tasted that intimacy....that acceptance from one another... and you want more. If allowing someone to come so close to you that it has brought you to this moment full of happiness, joy, and celebration, imagine where it will take you.</p>\
<p>As you pursue intimacy in marriage you will find that it will also lead you to something else.  For now that you feel safe enough and secure enough in another's love to be vulnerable, something special happens.</p>\
<p>One author puts it this way,</p><p>'One of the best wedding gifts [life] gave you was a full-length mirror called your spouse.  Had there been a card attached, it would have said, 'Here's to helping you discover what you're really like.''</p>\
<p>Now I don't think that's a bad thing.  Having someone so close that they can peer into the depths of your soul and reflect back what they see will do nothing but make you a better person.  Your partner will call you out when you're being ridiculous or when you're not doing your part.  Your companion will give you encouragement to hold true to your values and ideals.  Having a husband/wife in marriage will only make you stronger, wiser, more self aware, more compassionate, and more loving.  Thirty years down the line you will be able to look at each other and honestly say, 'because of you, I am a better person.'</p><br/><p>";

  "<strong>Cheesy Humor with The Art of Marriage</strong><br/><span class='brideName'>________</span> and <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, Marriage is an alliance entered into by a man who can't sleep with a window shut, and a woman who can't sleep with the window open.  </p><p>Of course I'm joking, but if we take a moment to peel back a layer of this 'attempted humor', we observe a greater truth pertaining to all marriages.  As a man and women come together to be husband and wife....as they become one and attempt to align their values, priorities, and goals....there will always be pieces (ideology, habits, or values) that just don't easily fit together.  There are compromising and agreements made in order to make the marriage thrive.</p><p>If you think about it, this is at the source of most references to marriage within humor.  For example:</p><p>'A happy home is one in which each spouse grants the possibility that the other may be right, though neither believes it.'</p><p>Two people coming together in a union of marriage does not work like snapping pieces together.  We're not here because you, <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, and you, <span class='brideName'>________</span>, looked at each other and thought, 'our lives will assimilate and integrate with relative ease.'</p><p>We're here today because when you, <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, look into <span class='brideName'>________</span> and you, <span class='brideName'>________</span>, look into <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, you see something beautiful. You admire the qualities the other possesses.  You understand the true value of each other and will do anything to be together for the rest of their life.</p><p>And this is the beauty of marriage.  Two people who admire and love each other so deeply and who will do anything...overcome any obstacles, working through any friction.... to be together. </p><p>Wilferd Peterson furthers this thought in a poem titled, 'The Art of Marriage.'   In this poem, he looks not just at how to keep a strong marriage, but how to fill it with happiness.</p><p>Happiness in marriage is not something that just happens. <br/>A good marriage must be created.<br/>In the art of marriage the little things are the big things...<br/>It is never being too old to hold hands.<br/>It is remembering to say 'I love you' at least once a day.<br/>It is never going to sleep angry.<br/>It is at no time taking the other for granted;<br/>the courtship should not end with the honeymoon,it should continue through all the years.<br/>It is having a mutual sense of values and common objectives.<br/>It is standing together facing the world.<br/>It is forming a circle of love that gathers in the whole family.<br/>It is doing things for each other, not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, but in the spirit of joy.<br/>It is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways.<br/>It is not looking for perfection in each other.<br/>It is cultivating flexibility, patience, understanding and a sense of humour.<br/>It is having the capacity to forgive and forget.<br/>It is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow.<br/>It is finding room for the things of the spirit.<br/>It is a common search for the good and the beautiful.<br/>It is establishing a relationship in which the independence is equal, dependence is mutual and the obligation is reciprocal.<br/>It is not only marrying the right partner, it is being the right partner.<br/>It is discovering what marriage can be, at its best.</p><p><span class='brideName'>________</span> and <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, your family and friends who are present here today wish for you the wisdom, compassion, and consistency to create a beautiful marriage in which you can both grow in love and happiness</p><p>";

Let it be a reminder that love needs to be offered and not just felt.</p><p>When others see the ring they will know you're married.  When you see your ring and when you feel it on your hand, you should be reminded that your love needs to displayed and conveyed in action.  </p>";

It becomes an extension of your hand.</p><p>So this ring that embodies your vows...your promises eventually becomes an extension of your hand.  In other words, you become your ring....you become your vows.  At first, the ring is a symbol of the vows you have made...it contains them, but during that change when the ring begins to mold to your finger, you become the ring, because you begin to embody the vows.  Instead of the ring being only a symbol of the the promise to love and cherish' you become the love and you display the action of one who cherishes.  You are no longer holding onto promises of sticking around through better and worse, but you begin to live it out....You hold on...you work through.  You take on the process of honoring and respecting that you said you would.  As you place the rings on each other's finger, the ring is a symbol, a promise, that one day...many days...many years... you will fulfill.</p>";

Fire and flood and trolls and imps.<br/>\
Is your train a minute slothful?<br/>\
I goad the stationmaster wrothful.<br/><br/>\
When with friends to bridge you drive<br/>\

And when you linger late in shops<br/>\
I long to telephone the cops.<br/><br/>\
Yet how worth the waiting for,<br/>\
To see you coming through the door.<br/>\
Somehow, I can be complacent<br/>\
Never but with you adjacent.<br/><br/>\
Near and far, near and far,<br/>\
I am happy where you are;<br/>\
Likewise I have never larnt<br/>\
How to be it where you aren't.<br/><br/>\

You can steer your self any direction you choose</p>\
<p>You're on your own, and you know what you know.<br/>\
And YOU are the couple who'll decide where to go<br/>\
You'll look up and down streets.  Look 'em over with care.<br/>\

And you may not find any you’ll want to go down.<br/>\
In that case, of course,   you'll head straight out of town</p>\
<p>It's opener there in the wide open air, <br/>\
Out there things can happen and frequently do <br/>\
To people as brainy and footsy as you<br/>\
And when things start to happen don't worry. Don't stew<br/>\
Just go right along. You'll start happening too </p>\
<p>Oh! The places you'll go!!<br/>\
You'll be on your way up!<br/>\
You'll be seeing great sights<br/>\
You'll join the high fliers<br/>\

  "<p><strong> CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN</strong> by Louis Bernjeres<br/>\
Love is temporary madness: it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides.  And when it subsides you have to make a decision.  You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part.  Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of eternal passion.  That is just being in love, which any fool can do.  Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and that is both an art and a fortunate accident.  Those that truly love have roots that grow towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms have fallen from their branches, the find that they are the one tree and not two.</p>";

  Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it's like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt that you planned on falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it.</p>";

  "<p><strong> JAZZ</strong> by Toni Morrison<br/>\
It's nice when grown people whisper to each other under the covers. Their ecstasy is more leaf-sigh than bray and the body is the vehicle, not the point. They reach, grown people, for something beyond, way beyond and way, way down underneath tissue. They are remembering while they whisper the carnival dolls they won and the Baltimore boats they never sailed on. The pears they let hang on the limb because if they plucked them, they would be gone from there and who else would see that ripeness if they took it away for themselves? How could anybody passing by see them and imagine for themselves what the flavor would be like? Breathing and murmuring under covers both of them have washed and hung out on the line, in a bed they chose together and kept together nevermind one leg was propped on a 1916 dictionary, and the mattress, curved like a preacher's palm asking for witnesses in His name's sake, enclosed them each and every night and muffled their whispering, old-time love. They are under the covers because they don't have to look at themselves anymore; there is no stud's eye, no chippie glance to undo them. They are inward toward the other, bound and joined by carnival dolls and the steamers that sailed from ports they never saw. That is what is beneath their undercover whispers.</p>";

  "<p><strong>THE IRRATIONAL SEASON</strong> by Madeleine L'Engle<br/>\
But ultimately there comes a moment when a decision must be made. Ultimately two people who love each other must ask themselves how much they hope for as their love grows and deepens, and how much risk they are willing to take...It is indeed a fearful gamble...Because it is the nature of love to create, a marriage itself is something which has to be created, so that, together we become a new creature.</p>\
<p>To marry is the biggest risk in human relations that a person can take...If we commit ourselves to one person for life this is not, as many people think, a rejection of freedom; rather it demands the courage to move into all the risks of freedom, and the risk of love which is permanent; into that love which is not possession, but participation...It takes a lifetime to learn another person…When love is not possession, but participation, then it is part of that co-creation which is our human calling, and which implies such risk that it is often rejected.</p>";

  "<p><strong> GIFT FROM THE SEA</strong> by Anne Morrow Lindbergh<br/>\
When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in growth, in fluidity - in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the same pattern.</p>\
<p>The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia, nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation, but living in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now. Relationships must be like islands, one must accept them for what they are here and now, within their limits - islands, surrounded and interrupted by the sea, and continually visited and abandoned by the tides.</p>";

  "<p><strong> An excerpt from A FAREWELL TO ARMS</strong> by Ernest Hemingway<br/>\
At night, there was the feeling that we had come home, feeling no longer alone, waking in the night to find the other one there, and not gone away; all other things were unreal. We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a woman wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. We were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.</p>";

  "<p><strong> Plato's SYMPOSIUM </strong><br/>\
Humans have never understood the power of Love, for if they had they would surely have built noble temples and altars and offered solemn sacrifices; but this is not done, and most certainly ought to be done, since Love is our best friend, our helper, and the healer of the ills which prevent us from being happy.</p>\
<p>To understand the power of Love, we must understand that our original human nature was not like it is now, but different. Human beings each had two sets of arms, two sets of legs, and two faces looking in opposite directions. There were three sexes then: one comprised of two men called the children of the Sun, one made of two women called the children of the Earth, and a third made of a man and a woman, called the children of the Moon. Due to the power and might of these original humans, the Gods began to fear that their reign might be threatened. They sought for a way to end the humans' insolence without destroying them.</p>\
<p>It was at this point that Zeus divided the humans in half. After the division the two parts of each desiring their other half, came together, and throwing their arms about one another, entwined in mutual embraces, longing to grow into one. So ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, making one of two, and healing the state of humankind.</p>\
<p>Each of us when separated, having one side only, is but the indenture of a person, and we are always looking for our other half. Those whose original nature lies with the children of the Sun are men who are drawn to other men, those from the children of the Earth are women who love other women, and those from the children of the Moon are men and women drawn to one another. And when one of us meets our other half, we are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and would not be out of the other’s sight even for a moment. We pass our whole lives together, desiring that we should be melted into one, to spend our lives as one person instead of two, and so that after our death there will be one departed soul instead of two; this is the very expression of our ancient need. And the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called Love.</p>";

Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? Fall head over heels. I say find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love - well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived. </p>";

So ought men to love their wives as their own body; He that loves his wife loves himself</p>\
<p>For no man ever yet hateth his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.

God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'  Then God said, 'I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.  And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground- everything that has the breath of life in it- I give every green plant for food.'

  "<p><strong> SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE, XIV</strong> by Elizabeth Barrett Browning<br/>\
If thou must love me, let it be for nought<br/>\
Except for love's sake only. Do not say<br/>\
'I love her for her smile--her look--her way<br/>\
Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought<br/>\
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought<br/>\
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day'--<br/>\
For these things in themselves, Beloved, may<br/>\
Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,<br/>\
May be unwrought so. Neither love me for<br/>\
Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--<br/>\
A creature might forget to weep, who bore<br/>\
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!<br/>\
But love me for love's sake, that evermore<br/>\
Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.</p>";

The breathing in unison</p>\

 This is a special place, a place where people have brought beautiful living plants, here to establish them, to nurture and care for them, that they may forever surround us with the beauty we now see.  And into this place where we stand, you have brought something beautiful -- the relationship that is becoming your marriage.  Here you are declaring it and pledging it, promising to establish and nurture it.</p>\
<p>  We are aware of the special beauty between the two of you, just as we are aware of the special beauty of this place.  We are with you now in this appropriate place to celebrate your relationship as it is and as it is yet to be, and in doing so, we ask only that you remember how your life together will have the same seasons and needs as this garden.  </p>\
<p>There will be growth like spring and loss like fall; there will be giving as the blossoming flower, and rest as the seed beneath the snow.  All the seasons will be yours, but remember, too, that gardens are not just happenings.</p>\
<p>The more wonderful the garden, the more skilled the gardener.  So you will have to care deeply for the life that is yours together, and nurture it.  You will have to appreciate your differences and cultivate them. You will have to take care of yourself, if for no other reason than out of love for the other. </p>\
<p>And you will need the support of family and friends to reach full growth.  As you caringly chose this place to declare your marriage, so remember its lessons for your life together, through the seasons that are yours to share.  And may those seasons bring you a full harvest of joy and happiness.</p>";

  Love is just not looking at each other and saying 'You're wonderful'.<br/>\
  There are times when we are anything but wonderful.<br/>\
  Love is looking out in the same direction.<br/>\
  It is linking our strength to pull a common load.<br/>\
  It is pushing together towards the far horizons, hand in hand.<br/>\
  Love is knowing that when our strength falters, <br/>we can borrow the strength of someone who cares.<br/>\
  Love is a strange awareness that our sorrows will be shared and made lighter by sharing;<br/>\
  that joys will be enriched and multiplied by the joy of another.<br/>\
  Love is knowing someone else cares that we are not alone in life.</p>";

  <p>From now on your thoughts shall be for each other rather than your individual selves. Your plans shall be mutual, your joys and sorrows shall be shared alike.

I ask that you remember this moment and that when words fail you, that you place a single rose on your spouse's pillow as a way to say, 'I remember our vow,'  and 'I love you'.  Let this exchanging of roses be the beginning of a lifelong tradition of unspoken love</p>";

  "<p>Your gift to each other for your wedding today has been your wedding rings - which shall always be an outward demonstration of your vows of love and respect; and a public showing of your commitment to each other.</p>\
  <p>You now have what remains the most honorable title which may exist between a man and a woman - the title of 'husband' and 'wife.' For your first gift as husband and wife, that gift will be a single rose.</p>\
  <p>In the past, the rose was considered a symbol of love and a single rose always meant only one thing - it meant the words 'I love you.' So it is appropriate that for your first gift - as husband and wife - that gift would be a single rose.</p>\
  <p>Please exchange your first gift as husband and wife. In some ways it seems like you have not done anything at all. Just a moment ago you were holding one small rose - and now you are holding one small rose. In some ways, a marriage ceremony is like this. In some ways, tomorrow is going to seem no different than yesterday. But in fact today, just now, you both have given and received one of the most valuable and precious gifts of life - one I hope you always remember - the gift of true and abiding love within the devotion of marriage.</p>\
  <p><span class='brideName'>________</span> and <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, I would ask that where ever you make your home in the future - whether it be a large and elegant home - or a small and graceful one - that you both pick one very special location for roses; so that on each anniversary of this truly wonderful occasion you both may take a rose to that spot both as a recommitment to your marriage - and a recommitment that THIS will be a marriage based upon love. </p>\
  <p>In every marriage there are times where it is difficult to find the right words. It is easiest to hurt who we most love. It is easiest to be most hurt by who we most love. It might be difficult some time to words to say 'I am sorry' or 'I forgive you'; 'I need you' or 'I am hurting'. If this should happen, if you simply can not find these words, leave a rose at that spot which both of you have selected - for that rose than says what matters most of all and should overpower all other things and all other words.</p>\
  <p>That rose says the words: 'I still love you.' The other should accept this rose for the words which cannot be found, and remember the love and hope that you both share today.</p>\
  <p><span class='brideName'>________</span> and <span class='groomName'>_ _ _ _</span>, if there is anything you remember of this marriage ceremony, it is that it was love that brought you here today, it is only love which can make it a glorious union, and it is by love which your marriage shall endure.</p>";

<p>Along with that, we see another characteristic in receiving the tea from one another.  There is an appreciation of each other's thoughtfulness... and a recognition that you need to express your love and for it to be received.</p>\
